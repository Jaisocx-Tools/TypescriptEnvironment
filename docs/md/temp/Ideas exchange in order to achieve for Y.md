Ideas exchange in order to achieve for Your Company the best sites performance and user experience. I admire Your Know How on clever routing for the best packets delivery, me never can do, and I have since Computer Colledge 1994 and Software Development since 2003 nice thoughts on ASM instructions costs, and after some feedback to me of Employers in Companies where I did coding tasks, I read the best coding practices and patterns 2025 and prettifying the code, since the Grand Daughter Masha of my Spouse Svitlana likes well seeing toys))

I hope to achieve the well built business or coding coworking relationship with Your Company.

My ideas I planned to implement in the next 5 Years or very earlier))

1. The Clever Caching Trigger and the Caching Deamon to my jaisocx.com InConfig caching feature.
2. the published on github built with Angular Sites for jaisocx.com: Admin, Email client, published Filesystem path view.
3. database server the fewest MB size and fewest features, just ORM, Https API with Jaisocx https, OrderBy and simpliest filter. other queries results refinements are perfected with programming not implemented in this database core. I shall try to avoid the while true coding practice, too. And have to consult with some OS devs to have the ports to register the events handlers for controllers signals after 200th byte or similar)) You know what I think of.
4. security bugsfixing for my EmailServer software. There is no incoming messages DKIM and SPF validation and no these infos in delivery reports and no ESMPT exceptions reports.
5. to rebuild and to review my DNS server software.
6. Advanced Programming Model for Jaisocx server and it's Https API.
7. Out of the box Advanced fast files upload (tested well with 12GB video file) is in development for now.
8. Learning C and Assembly and Intel's docs for the friendlier code))

Many other nice ideas also.

With the mc site load speed, we can achieve the time to regard the few authorizing persons when entering high sensitive sites. On demand of these companies and clients, having these sights, while keeping the best normal site load speed, performance and user experience.

Have a nice day.

The best greetings,
