## 1. Arts of Javascript, by JS Synthax Dialect

1. **Javascript**

2. **Typescript**: like Javascript, however with many finer features, 
like the one of them, the variables declarations require notes of variables datatypes,
what improves documentation quality 
and helps to implement easier IDEs' intelligency engines for .ts than for .js,
when relaying on typed scripting language.

The Javascript remains without datatyping, and this is the very nice flavour, too,
since methods for interactivity on InetSites can be written very very easy and fast 
in few tens of minutes.





## 2. Types of Bundles of Classes Available to JS Engines

1. **Invoked by InetSites Browsers' JS Engines**: 
for higher security level, 
since You don't know,
what .js script is loading on navigation to a site,
and a newer site,
mostly just painting on Your display in open browser's tab,
and dinamique loading data from Inet for rendering,
texts in json datasets.




2. **Invoked by Node JS Engine installed on Your computer**:
wide range of classes, 
reading and writing files, querying databases, 
presuming, these .ts or .js scripts are invoked by You,
and You know what .js files You invoke.



## 3. Arts of Scripts, .ts or .js both, by Tasks and JS Engines, having invoked a script.

1. **ClientSide Scripts**: loaded as is by InetSites Browsers, as having navigated to a site, then invoked by JS Engines of InetSites Browsers on events, like load, unload, and interactivity events.

    **Debug of client side .js**: in the InetSites Browser Developers Console


2. **ServerSide Backend Scripts**: read from the Server Machine's file system and invoked by `Node` JS Engine. Node is invoked by the installed on the same Server Machine InetSites Server, like the Server of the Express Framework, producing dinamique data, being sent to InetSites Borwsers as sites markup in HTML and JSON datasets as databases queries results.

   **Debug of server side node .js**: with a plugin in IDE suitable for development of server side .js or .ts


3. **Terminal Scripts**: local .js files invoked by `node` cli, and Node invoked by Command Line Shell Engine ( mostly having the command line shell been installed along with OS ).

    **Debug of local node .js invoked in Terminal**
